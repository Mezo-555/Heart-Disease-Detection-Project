# Accuracy Comparison: Expert System vs. Decision Tree Model

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Validation Set Evaluation
Both the **Rule-Based Expert System** and the **Decision Tree Model** were tested on an unseen validation dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`). Below are the performance results.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Metrics
### üìä **Decision Tree Model Results:**
| Metric      | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 0.9854 |
| Precision  | 1.0000 |
| Recall     | 0.9709 |
| F1-Score   | 0.9852 |

### üìú **Expert System Results:**
| Metric      | Score  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | 0.5132 |
| Precision  | 0.5132 |
| Recall     | 1.0000 |
| F1-Score   | 0.6783 |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Findings
‚úÖ **Decision Tree Model** achieved **higher accuracy and precision**, likely due to data-driven learning.  
‚úÖ **Expert System** performed well in recall but had **lower overall accuracy**, suggesting it may generate more false positives.  
‚úÖ **Decision Trees can adapt** to unseen patterns, while the **Expert System relies on predefined rules**, making it less flexible.  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Explainability: Decision Tree vs. Expert System
| Feature                    | Decision Tree Model | Expert System |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Data-Driven               | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No        |
| Human Interpretability    | ‚ùå Limited        | ‚úÖ High      |
| Adapts to New Data        | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No        |
| Consistency in Decisions  | ‚ùå May vary       | ‚úÖ Always follows rules |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion
The **Decision Tree Model** provides **better accuracy** but lacks explainability, whereas the **Expert System is easier to interpret** but less flexible. Depending on the application, a hybrid approach might be beneficial!
